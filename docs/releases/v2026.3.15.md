# v2026.3.15 — 2026-03-02

## Added
- **Runtime library version guard** — integration now checks python-yarbo version at startup; raises `ConfigEntryNotReady` with actionable error if library is too old (prevents stale `/config/deps/` issues)
- **Regression tests** for `get_controller(timeout=...)` compatibility and `MIN_LIB_VERSION` constant

## Fixed
- **Blocking call warnings eliminated** — Sentry init runs in executor, import caches pre-warmed (`idna`, `paho-mqtt`, `certifi`, `charset-normalizer`), TCP socket check for broker reachability
- **Event loop closed RuntimeError** — guarded `call_soon_threadsafe` against closed loops in MQTT disconnect callback

## Changed
- `MIN_LIB_VERSION` set to `2026.3.15`
- Version bump to 2026.3.15
