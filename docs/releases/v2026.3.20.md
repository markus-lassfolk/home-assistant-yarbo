# v2026.3.20 — 2026-03-02

## Fixed
- **Config flow discovery timeout** — capped at 10 seconds; falls through to manual IP/port entry if no robot found, preventing the wizard from hanging indefinitely
- **Blocking I/O in version guard** — `importlib.metadata.version()` now runs in executor thread to avoid event loop warnings on HA 2026.2+

## Changed
- Community disclaimer added to README
